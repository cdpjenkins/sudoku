# Sudoku

The purpose of this repository is to hold my attempts at solving Sudoku in various languages.

All are strongly influenced by [Peter Norvig's Sudoku solver](https://norvig.com/sudoku.html), but manage to be
somewhat less elegant.

A Clojure Sudoku solver (which I wrote many years ago, after the first time
that I read Peter Norvig's post) can be found [here](https://github.com/cdpjenkins/clodoku).
